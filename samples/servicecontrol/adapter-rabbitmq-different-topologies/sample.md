This sample shows how to configure ServiceControl to monitor endpoints and retry messages when using the RabbitMQ direct routing topology. ServiceControl by default supports only the default RabbitMQ routing topology, therefore a kind of "transport adapter" is required to monitor systems using other routing topologies. 


## Prerequisites

 1. [Install ServiceControl](/servicecontrol/installation.md).
 2. Install RabbitMQ broker on localhost.
 3. Using [ServiceControl Management](/servicecontrol/license.md#servicecontrol-management-app) tool, set up ServiceControl to monitor endpoints using RabbitMQ transport:
	 
   * Add a new ServiceControl instance.
   * Use default `Particular.ServiceControl` as the instance name (ensure there is no other instance of SC running with the same name).
   * Specify `host=localhost` as a connection string. ServiceControl Management Utility will automatically create queues and exchanges on the broker.

 4. Ensure the `ServiceControl` process is running before running the sample.
 5. [Install ServicePulse](/servicepulse/installation.md)

NOTE: In order to connect to a different RabbitMQ broker, ensure all connection strings in the sample are updated.

## Code walk-through 

The code base consists of three projects.


### Sales Endpoint

The Sales project contains an endpoint that simulates the execution of a business process by exchanging messages with the Sales endpoint. It includes a message processing failure simulation mode (toggled by pressing `f`) which can be used to generate failed messages that demonstrate message retry functionality. The Sales endpoint uses the RabbitMQ direct routing topology and requires an adapter in order to communicate with ServiceControl.

The following code configures the Sales endpoint to communicate with the adapter:

snippet: SalesConfiguration


### Shipping Endpoint

The Shipping project also contains an endpoint that simulates the execution of a business process by exchanging messages with the Shipping endpoint. It includes message processing failure simulation mode (toggled by pressing `f`) which can be used to generate failed messages that demonstrate message retry functionality.

The Shipping endpoint uses the RabbitMQ direct routing topology and requires an adapter in order to communicate with ServiceControl.

The Shipping endpoint has the Heartbeats plugin installed to enable uptime monitoring via ServicePulse.

The following code configures the Shipping endpoint to communicate with the adapter:

snippet: ShippingConfiguration


### Adapter

The Adapter project hosts the `ServiceControl.TransportAdapter`. The adapter has two sides: endpoint-facing and ServiceControl-facing. In this sample the ServiceControl-facing side uses the RabbitMQ transport with the default conventional routing topology:

snippet: AdapterTransport

The following code configures the adapter to use the RabbitMQ direct routing topology when communicating with the business endpoints:

snippet: EndpointSideConfig

The following code configures names of the queues used by the adapter and ServiceControl:
